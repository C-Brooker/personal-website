              As someone who enjoys being both creative and innovative I found
              that creating something out of nothing through coding was a great
              experience that I definitely wanted to grow at. I initially
              started by learning the fundamentals of Python to get a simple
              understanding of key-programming constructs and from this I
              decided to branch out into front-end development using JavaScript,
              HTML5, CSS3 and React to create the website you are using now.
              From completing this website I learned how to effectively learn
              and apply new programming concepts. For the future, I want to
              continously develop my coding ability as well as diversify my
              skill-set. Because of this, while expanding my knowledge of React
              and Javascript, I will also begin teaching myself Java so that
              eventually I will be able to effectively tackle full-stack
              problems.

              <h5 className={styles.topHeader}>Investing</h5>I have recently
              started to invest into the crypto-currency markets, using my wages
              from McDonalds. In order to maximise my returns, I consistently
              perform thorough market research and make sure that I am up to

              <h5 className={styles.header}>Running</h5>I initially started
              running as a simple challenge of the couch to 5k. However, from
              doing this challenge I developed a love for running long distances
              and developing my own mental fortitude to consistently push myself
              further. Now, I frequently organise trail-runs with my friends as
              I find it is a scenic way to enjoy my passion for running
              <h5 className={styles.header}>Cooking</h5> I enjoy exercising my
              creativity thorough learning and practising new recipes. It is
              always interesting to turn individual items into a dish that is
              stunning to look at, tastes phenomenal and provides me with the
              opportunity to expand my cookery ability.
